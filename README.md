lua-hires-time
==

A library to measure the system time with high resolution for lua.

Synopsis
--

```lua
local hires_time = require 'hires_time'

local epoch_micros, err = hires_time.get_epoch_micros()
if err ~= nil then
    -- error handling...
end
```

See also [example](/example/).

Description
--

This package provides a method to measure (and dispense) the system time with high resolution.

Lua runtime's `os.time()` returns the epoch __second__ of the system, however, there is no way to get more high accuracy one. So this library measures and returns the system time as __microseconds__.

The library bridges to `gettimeofday()` function of `sys/time.h`.

Functions
--

### `get_epoch_micros()`

This function measures and returns the system epoch time as __microseconds__.

#### Return value

This method returns the values that accords the following order:

- `epoch_micros` (number or nil): The system epoch time. This variable represents __microseconds__.
- `err` (string or nil): Error response

When `err` is nil, `epoch_micros` has an actual number value. On the other hand, when `err` is not nil, `epoch_micros` is nil.

Disclaimer
--

This library doesn't work on Windows (I have a will to support it).
